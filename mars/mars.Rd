\title{Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)}
\usage{
mars(formula, data, control = mars.control())
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the model to fit, with the response on the left of a \code{~}
and predictors on the right, separated by \code{+} symbols.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables specified in the formula.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters for the fitting process. If not specified,
defaults are provided by \code{mars.control()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mars}, which includes the fitted model among other components:
\describe{
\item{call}{The matched call to the \code{mars} function.}
\item{formula}{The model formula.}
\item{y}{The response variable from the provided data.}
\item{B}{The matrix of basis functions used in the model.}
\item{Bfuncs}{Details of the basis functions selected during the model fitting process.}
\item{x_names}{Names of the predictor variables.}
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{lm} representing the linear model fit to the selected terms.}
}
The \code{mars} object supports standard methods like \code{print}, \code{summary}, and \code{plot}.
}
\description{
This function fits a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model to the provided data
using the specified formula. MARS is a non-parametric regression technique that models
complex relationships by fitting piecewise linear regressions. This implementation includes
a forward selection phase to add terms to the model and a backward elimination phase to prune
terms, optimizing model complexity and fit.
}
\details{
The MARS model fitting process includes both forward selection to add interaction
terms and basis functions, followed by backward elimination to remove less impactful terms.
This ensures the model captures complex interactions and nonlinearities in the data while
maintaining parsimony.
