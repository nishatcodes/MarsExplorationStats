\title{ANOVA for MARS Model Objects}
\usage{
\method{anova}{mars}(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A fitted MARS model object. This object should contain the basis function matrix \code{B},
the response variable \code{y}, model coefficients, residuals, and fitted values as its components.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It performs its analysis and prints the results to the console for each term in the model.
For each term, the following metrics are printed:
\itemize{
\item Variance explained by the term
\item Residual variance for the term
\item Fitted value variance for the term
}
}
\description{
Performs an ANOVA-like variance decomposition for a fitted MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) model object.
It calculates and displays the variance explained by each term in the model, as well as the residual and fitted value variances associated with each term.
}
\details{
The function iterates over each term in the basis function matrix \code{B} of the provided MARS model object.
For each term, it calculates the variance explained by the term, the variance of the residuals associated with the term,
and the variance of the fitted values. It handles the intercept term separately, identifying it with a special notation if present.
This analysis can help in understanding the contribution of each term to the model's explanatory power.
