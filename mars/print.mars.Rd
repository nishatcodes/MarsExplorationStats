\title{Displays a summary of a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model,
including the original function call and the coefficients for each of the basis
functions in the model. This function is designed to enhance the interpretability
and transparency of MARS model outputs by providing a clear and structured summary.}
\usage{
\method{print}{mars}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A MARS model object that contains the details of the model, including
the model's call and basis function coefficients.}
}
\value{
Invisible. This function is called for its side effect, which is
printing the MARS model summary to the console.
