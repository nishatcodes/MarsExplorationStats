\title{Summary for MARS Model Objects}
\usage{
\method{summary}{mars}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A MARS model object, expected to contain components like the model formula, coefficients, residuals, and observed values (\verb{$y}). Ensure the object is the result of fitting a MARS model.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with components of the model summary, including formula, number of terms, coefficients, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, residual mean, and residual standard deviation. This function is primarily used for its side effect of printing the summary to the console.
