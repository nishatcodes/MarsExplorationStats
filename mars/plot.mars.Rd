\title{Plot Diagnostics for MARS Model Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mars}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mars}, typically the output from fitting a MARS model.
It must contain at least the residuals and fitted values.}
}
\description{
Generates diagnostic plots for assessing the fit of a MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) model,
including a Residuals vs. Fitted plot and a Residual QQ plot. These plots are useful for evaluating the
assumption of homoscedasticity and normality of the residuals.
}
\details{
The function creates two diagnostic plots:
\enumerate{
\item{Residuals vs Fitted:} Plots the residuals against the fitted values to check for constant variance
(homoscedasticity) and identify any obvious patterns (which may suggest non-linearity).
\item{Residual QQ Plot:} Plots the quantiles of residuals against the theoretical quantiles from a normal
distribution. This plot is useful for checking the normality of residuals.
}
Both plots are essential diagnostics for linear regression analysis and can similarly inform the quality
of a MARS model fit.
